# Deployment Guide - Publication Formatter

## 🚀 Alternative Deployment Methods

Since the Vercel CLI deployment is encountering npm install issues, here are alternative methods:

### Method 1: GitHub + Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Publication Formatter - Ready for deployment"
   git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy via Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect React Router and deploy

### Method 2: Netlify Deployment

1. **Push to GitHub** (same as above)

2. **Deploy via Netlify:**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose your repository
   - Set build command: `npm run build`
   - Set publish directory: `build/client`
   - Deploy

### Method 3: Manual Build & Deploy

1. **Build locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Upload build folder:**
   - Upload the `build/client` folder to any static hosting service
   - Examples: GitHub Pages, Firebase Hosting, AWS S3

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If npm install fails on Vercel:

1. **Check Node.js version compatibility**
2. **Remove problematic dependencies** (already done)
3. **Use GitHub integration instead of CLI**
4. **Try different hosting platforms**

### Current Status:
